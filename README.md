# Huntington’s Disease R Shiny Application BF591
## Overview
The application is an interactive R Shiny dashboard designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of Huntington’s Disease (HD) transcriptomic data from Labadorf et al. (GEO accession: GSE64810). It offers a user-friendly interface for examining sample metadata, normalized gene expression counts, differential expression (DE) results, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

The study utilized mRNA sequencing of post-mortem BA5 human brain tissue samples, including:
* 20 samples from individuals diagnosed with Huntington’s disease
* 45 age- and sex-matched neurologically healthy controls

## Features
### 1. Samples Tab
* Upload sample metadata (CSV format)
* Summary: Displays column names, data types, and numeric column means
* Table: Interactive, searchable, and sortable data table
* Plots: Histogram of user-selected numeric metadata variable

### 2. Counts Tab
* Upload normalized counts matrix (CSV format from GEO)
* Apply filters with sliders for:
  * Gene variance percentile
  * Minimum number of non-zero samples
* Summary: Table of passing vs. non-passing genes after filtering
* Diagnostics: Scatterplots of variance and zero-count thresholds
* Heatmap: Log-transformed gene counts after filtering
* PCA: Principal Component Analysis (interactive axis selection)

### 3. Differential Expression (DE) Tab
* Upload DE results (CSV from GEO supplementary files)
* Input: Interactive table of raw DE results
* Result:
  * Volcano Plot with customizable axes, highlight colors, and significance threshold
  * Filtered Table based on adjusted p-value cutoff

### 4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Tab
* Upload preprocessed GSEA results (CSV file)
* Barplot: Top positive and negative enriched pathways
* Table:
  * Filter by adjusted p-value threshold
  * Filter by positive/negative enrichment scores (NES)
  * Download filtered table as CSV
* Scatterplot: NES vs. -log10(adjusted p-value) with threshold highlighting

## Data Sources
* Sample metadata: SRA Run Selector metadata for Huntington’s Disease dataset
* Normalized counts matrix: Downloaded from GEO accession (supplementary files)
* Differential expression results: GEO supplementary data
* GSEA analysis: Performed with MSigDB C2 curated gene sets

## Requirements
The application was built in R using the following packages:
* shiny
* DT
* tidyverse
* colourpicker
* ggplot2
* reshape2
* pheatmap
* fgsea

## Running the Application
* Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

* Install required R packages (if not already installed):
```
install.packages(c("shiny", "DT", "tidyverse", "colourpicker", "ggplot2", "reshape2", "pheatmap"))
BiocManager::install("fgsea")
```

* Launch the Shiny app:
```
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

## Usage
* Download the GSE64810 dataset from NCBI GEO
* Prepare your metadata, normalized counts, DE results, and GSEA results as CSV files.
* Upload the relevant files into each corresponding tab.
* Explore summaries, visualizations, and statistical analyses interactively.
